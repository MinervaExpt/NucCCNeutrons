#Brief: Reproduces Dan's Medium Energy port of Amy's Low Energy 2D
#       inclusive cross section in muon momentum components.  If I get
#       roughly the same answers, my event loop can't be too bad, right?

#Names in sidebands' "fails" blocks refer to truth cuts by block name.
#Backgrounds are well-constrained in the original (LE) inclusive 2D
#analysis.
sidebands:

#Backgrounds are defined by the truth::Cuts they pass in addition to
#failing some regular truth cut.  So, these cuts had better be mutually
#exclusive with regular truth::Cuts.
